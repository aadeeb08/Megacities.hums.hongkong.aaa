  <h2>Impacts on the City as a Result of Population Growth</h2>

  <h4>There are many impacts with Hong Kong with the fast-growing population.</h4>

  <p class="lh">Limited houses: Hong Kong's status as a densely populated metropolis is no secret.  However, its compact size presents a significant challenge: a lack of space for new housing.  Unlike sprawling cities that can expand outwards, Hong Kong is hemmed in by geography, with limited opportunities for land reclamation. This scarcity of developable land, coupled with a growing population, creates a perfect storm for a housing crisis. With more people vying for a finite number of dwellings, the dream of homeownership could become increasingly distant for many residents.</p>
  <p class="pc">Property costs: The limited housing supply in Hong Kong is further exacerbated by population growth. As more people move to the city and families continue to grow, the demand for housing skyrockets. This intense competition for a limited resource drives rental prices and property values ever upwards.  For many residents, particularly those on fixed incomes, such skyrocketing costs push affordable housing out of reach. The unfortunate consequence of this trend is a rise in homelessness and a growing number of residents struggling to secure even basic accommodations.</p>
  <p class="lh2">Limited healthcare: The strain on resources extends beyond housing. A surge in population inevitably puts a significant burden on healthcare facilities. Hospitals and clinics could become overwhelmed, leading to longer wait times and potentially even a shortage of medical supplies.  With a larger population base requiring medical attention, there's a heightened risk of medicine shortages, making it even more difficult for people to access the care they need. This puts a strain on the entire healthcare system and could have a detrimental impact on the overall health and well-being of Hong Kong's residents.</p>
  <p class="eb">Educational Bottleneck: The domino effect of population growth doesn't stop at housing and healthcare. Educational resources are another area likely to experience strain. With more children entering the school system, class sizes could become overcrowded, potentially hindering the quality of education.  A shortage of qualified teachers could also arise, making it difficult to maintain a strong student-to-teacher ratio. This could limit the personalized attention students receive and put a damper on the overall learning experience.  Furthermore, competition for spots in universities could become even fiercer, potentially leaving some qualified students without access to higher education.</p>
