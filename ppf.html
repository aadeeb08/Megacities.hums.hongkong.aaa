    <h2>Push and Pull Factors</h2>

    <p class="me">Hong Kong, a cosmopolitan city with a unique blend of Chinese and British influences, faces both push and pull factors that can influence people's decisions to leave or stay. Here's a breakdown of some reasons why people might choose to emigrate from Hong Kong, or conversely, why Hong Kong might be an attractive destination:</p>

    <ul class="push">
      <p>Push Factors:</p>
      <p>High Cost of Living: Housing in Hong Kong is notoriously expensive, with some of the highest property prices in the world. This can be a major burden for residents, especially young people and families.</p>
      <p>Political Uncertainty: Since the implementation of the National Security Law in 2020, there have been concerns about a decrease in political freedoms in Hong Kong. This has led to social unrest and protests, and may be a factor for some people considering emigration.</p>
      <p>Limited Space: Hong Kong is a densely populated city, with limited living space. This can lead to a feeling of crampedness and a lack of privacy.</p>
    </ul>

    <ul class="pull">
      <p>Pull Factors:</p>
      <p>Economic Opportunities: Hong Kong is a major financial center with a strong economy. This attracts businesses and professionals from all over the world, offering good job prospects and high salaries.</p>
      <p>Global Outlook: Hong Kong is a cosmopolitan city with a multicultural population. It offers a unique blend of Eastern and Western influences, and is a great place to live for those who want to experience a different culture.</p>
      <p>Efficient Infrastructure: Hong Kong has a world-class transportation system, making it easy to get around the city. The city also boasts excellent public services and a high quality of life.</p>
