  <h1>Hong Kong</h1>

  <p class="me">Hong Kong is a major city and global financial hub in Southeastern China. It is a former British colony that was returned to China in 1997, since then it has been operating as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) with a high degree of autonomy in all areas except defense and foreign affairs. However, the recent implementation of the national security law has raised concerns about the future of Hong Kong's political and economic status.</p>
  <p class="region">Region: Southeast Asia, bordering the South China Sea.</p>
  <p class="prox">Proximity: Lies east of the Pearl River Estuary, around 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of Macau. Bordered to the north by Guangdong Province and the city of Shenzhen, with the Sham Chun River acting as the dividing line.</p>
  <p class="surr">Surroundings: Encompasses Hong Kong Island, Kowloon Peninsula, the New Territories, Lantau Island, and over 260 other islands and peninsulas. Surrounded by the South China Sea on all sides except the north.</p>
  <p class="land">Landmass: Total area is roughly 1,110 square kilometers (428 square miles), with land area accounting for 1,073 square kilometers (414 square miles). The highest point is Tai Mo Shan, reaching 957 meters (3,140 feet) above sea level.</p>
  <p id="me">Hong Kong's location at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta has historically made it a significant trading port. The bustling city acts as a gateway between mainland China and the rest of the world.</p>
